Motor Control Algorithm in EV
Field oriented control (FOC) is an efficient speed control mechanism for Brushless DC motors. It is similar to sinusoidal commutation but comes with some mathematical changes. Bacancy’s Motor controller design with FOC and Sinusoidal algorithm for best performance and efficiency. Algorithms implemented such that torque ripple will be less to get a smoother riding experience.
